# Find Your Hat

## Description
This project is a simple terminal game where the user must follow the correct path to find their hat. This project was built as part of the CodeCademy Back-End Engineering course.

## Features
This Project generates a playfield of chosen size (set in the config variables), renders the playfield in the terminal and takes user input to manoeuvre the player through the maze.

## How to use
Download the project, extract the files and run using ``node main.js``.

## Roadmap
- Update the game loop so that the player can play again without having to restart the game.
- trim the user input and convert it to lowercase to avoid user errors.
- I may separate the code into modules.
